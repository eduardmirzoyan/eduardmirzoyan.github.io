				<p>
					Hello, my name is Eduard Mirzoyan, and I am a dedicated and passionate software engineer with a broad spectrum of experiences and skills in the field. Over the years, I have amassed expertise in various specializations within software engineering that I hope will highlight me for my coming opportunities. Below, I have summarized my journey so far.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in Spring 2023 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My coursework covered a wide range of subjects, such as Operating Systems, Computer Security, Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and more. In academia, is where I learned the basics of Algorithms, Data Structures, Program Efficiency, Runtime Analysis, and Design Patterns.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Whilst in school, I had various experiences that taught me programming in a more group-based and professional setting. The first of which was the opportunity to work as a Lead Game Designer at Augminted Labs, although I was initially employed as a designer, where I brainstormed, prototyped, and produced design documents for game mechanics, level design, and UI. Due to the small team size, I also delved into the codebase in actually implementing and prototyping my designs. This position taught me the software development cycle in a professional setting, the importance of properly designing a robust system before implementation and effective inter-team communication.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Afterwards, right before graduation, I served as a Game Development Mentor at UC Berkeley's Game Design and Development Club. Leading a group of five students, I guided them through the entire process of game development using Unity. This experience taught me important soft skills such as leadership, mentorship and sympathy. As well as the technical skills of reviewing, understanding and critiquing another person’s code for the sake of their improvement.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Currently, post-graduation, I am working full-time as a Software Engineer at RheoSense, Inc. Here, I am serving as a Full-Stack Engineer using the .NET framework to build and maintain various Windows applications. I have garnered a plethora of professional skills during my time here. These skills include the Agile and Scrum project management methodologies, CI/CD practices, quality assurance and unit testing, bug-fixing, multitasking and working in a fast-paced environment. I have had the luxury of directly communicating and working closely with large biotech companies such as Johnson and Johnson, Thermo Fisher, Regeneron, and Eli Lilly.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					In my free time, I have undertaken several significant projects to continue to broaden my skill set in software engineering. Some examples include developing a Physics Simulation Engine in C++ in order to understand how the GPU is utilized via OpenGL. I created my own demo for a pathfinding agent in Unity to improve upon the existing Dijkstra’s pathfinding algorithm by incorporating a third dimension. I developed a light-weight version of the all-popular Git version control system in order to understand the inner workings of this omni-present tool that almost all developers use.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Throughout all these experiences I have become proficient in a wide range of programming languages. These languages are listed as such: Python, Java, C#, C++, C, GoLang, SQL, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Assembly x86, and RISC-V.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					In summary, my journey as a software engineer has been both challenging and rewarding, always filled with opportunities to learn, innovate, and contribute. I am passionate about leveraging my skills and experiences to create impactful software solutions and am always eager to tackle new challenges in this ever-evolving field.
